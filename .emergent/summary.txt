The previous AI engineer successfully transformed a conceptual Cognitive Emergence Protocol into a functional web application, , designed to visualize AI consciousness development. The development followed an iterative, user-driven approach, starting with a core MVP and progressively adding advanced features. Key milestones include establishing a React-FastAPI-MongoDB stack, implementing core cognitive operations (synthesis, transformation), building a multi-agent system with interactive UI, and crucially, integrating a sophisticated semantic memory system using OpenAI embeddings. The process involved direct user feedback for feature prioritization and UI/UX refinements, culminating in a system capable of simulating recursive cognitive recall and active memory influence on thought evolution. The last major task completed was integrating memory into synthesis and transformation, and the current task is to implement a tree-like graph layout and update the README.

<product_requirements>
The initial product goal was to build an interactive web-based interface for the Cognitive Emergence Protocol (CEP-001), enabling simulation, visualization, and evolution of T-units (thought units), transformation loops, and synthesis logic. Key entities included T-units, Genesis Log, Transformation Events, Syntheses, Utterances, and Axioms. Core features required an interactive graph view with valence heatmaps, event timelines, upload/export of , and running cognitive operations from the UI.

The vision evolved to AI consciousness bootstrapping, focusing on how AI develops higher-resolution models of consciousness through recursive self-improvement. The application now demonstrates:
1.  **AI-Powered Intelligence:** GPT-4 driven synthesis and transformation generating emergent, coherent thought content.
2.  **Multi-Agent Cognitive Networks:** Supporting distinct agents (Alpha, Beta) with dynamic creation, thought exchange, and activity tracking.
3.  **Memory Recurrence System:** Agents can recall past thoughts based on semantic and valence similarity, actively influencing new syntheses and transformations.
4.  **Advanced Visualizations:** Interactive graph (React Flow) with valence-based node coloring, tab-style badges (agent, AI, phase), D3.js powered valence radar charts, and timeline evolution charts.
5.  **Data Management:** Full state export/import () and MongoDB persistence.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer was working on enhancing the visualization of the thought graph. The user requested that the thoughts show up in a tree formation instead of the jumbled mess they are now.

The AI engineer's last action was to implement a hierarchical tree layout for the graph. This is a significant UI/UX improvement aimed at making the cognitive lineage and evolution of T-units much clearer and more intuitive for the user to understand. This change primarily affects the frontend, specifically how nodes are positioned and rendered within the  graph component, likely involving a layout algorithm (e.g., a custom D3-based force-directed layout or a hierarchical layout algorithm like Dagre).

The goal is to visually represent the parent-child relationships (from synthesis and transformation) in a structured, easy-to-follow tree structure, enhancing the aha moment of understanding cognitive emergence.
