# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

##   test_sequence: 0
##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

All core functionality for tree layout is working correctly including T-unit CRUD, synthesis, transformation, agent management, memory suggestions, multi-agent exchange, and analytics. Only the Genesis export endpoint failed with a 500 error, but this is not critical for the tree layout functionality."

        - working: false
          agent: "testing"
          comment: "Tree layout has several issues: 1) No edges are rendered between nodes despite parent-child relationships in data, 2) Synthesis operation doesn't add new nodes to the tree, 3) Node overlapping detected in horizontal layout, 4) Vertical spacing between levels is ~100px instead of the expected 200px specified in code. Transformation operation works correctly and adds new nodes. Horizontal centering of levels is working properly."
        - working: false
          agent: "testing"
          comment: "Additional testing confirms the edge rendering issue. DOM inspection shows no edge elements or paths are being created despite React Flow being properly initialized. The graph state shows 5 nodes but 0 edges. All nodes appear to be positioned on the same level (y=50) rather than in a hierarchical structure, suggesting the level calculation or parent-child relationship detection may not be working correctly."
        - working: false
          agent: "testing"
          comment: "Root cause identified: The T-unit data from the API has empty 'parents' and 'children' arrays. Sample data shows: Parents: [], Children: []. This explains why all nodes are positioned on the same level (as they're all treated as root nodes) and why no edges are rendered (no parent-child relationships). The tree layout algorithm itself appears to be correctly implemented, but it's not receiving the proper relationship data from the backend. Interestingly, synthesis operation does create a new level in the tree, suggesting the backend is establishing relationships for new operations but not for the initial data."
        - working: false
          agent: "testing"
          comment: "Code analysis reveals a specific bug: In the convertTUnitsToGraph function, the code builds parent-child relationships by populating node.children arrays in the nodeMap (lines 378-393), but then when creating edges, it uses tUnit.children arrays from the API data (lines 452-470) which are empty. The edge creation should use the populated node.children arrays from the nodeMap instead. This explains why the tree structure is calculated correctly (nodes are assigned levels) but no edges are rendered."
